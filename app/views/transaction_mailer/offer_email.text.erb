Hi <%= @seller.name %>,
<%= @buyer.name %> just sent you an offer for the following items you own in MPPbay:
<% @offers.each do |offer| %>

-<%= offer.item.title %>
  <% if !offer.item.price.nil?  %>
  Price: $<%= offer.item.price %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
-------
Total: $<%= @total_price %>
<% if !@comment.blank? %>
Comments from <%= @buyer.name %>:
<%= @comment %>
<% end %>

Please get in touch with <%= @buyer.name %> (email: <%= @buyer.email %>) to negotiate the terms, accept or decline the offer, etc. Also, if you close a deal, don't forget to mark the items as "sold" in MPPBay so other people don't try to make an additional offer by mistake.

Thanks,
MPPbay team

# MPPbay project

In this project I am practising newbie-level web app development skills to implement a simple e-commerce website.

The concept is similar to eBay: users can buy and sell stuff among themselves. The user in question are college/grad students who need are always looking for other students in order to get rid of their belongings when about to graduate, while admits want to look for bargains to get their new lives set up as fast and as simple as possible.
